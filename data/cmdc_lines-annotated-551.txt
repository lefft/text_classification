o|Uh-huh.
q|Who's this priest I'm thanking?
d|That's right.
o|Nice to meet you, Ma'am.
d|Read a lot about you, Nick.
o|I... submit to Our Lord.
d|It's not a Nelwyn baby.
d|I met a Presidential aide once at a social occasion.
d|I gave up my castles and my lands!
q|What can I do for you?
o|Good luck, sir.
q|Where can we go?
d|Clients come and go.
d|It relaxes me.
d|Merlin, I didn't know --
d|I haven't read that.
d|You hunt us like animals -- do you know how many you have slaughtered?!
c|Pull it right now or I'll blow your fucking head off and pull it myself!
d|I didn't.
q|So why did you come to my casino?
d|We provide opera.
q|Jon, where are we?
c|No, let's go.
q|Are you telling me Friedman didnt tell you I was here looking for him?
d|Gonna pluck us off the tit.
d|Yeah, cured polio.
d|Mom, I heard someone downstairs!
d|We're not talking, you're talking, and doing too damn much of it, if you ask me.
d|Maybe they're as scared of us as we are of them.
q|Did ya get the message, kid?
d|Just because it's a love story doesn't mean it can't have a decapitation or two.
d|We've certainly been in some swell jams.
d|He understands me fine.
o|Nothing you can't show up for with a stain.
d|I still don't see you.
q|No, what?
q|What's in the back?
d|I think he was running a test on an old rocket engine... and one of the fuel cells burst.
d|The power went out in half the park.
c|Go to sleep.
q|It worked out alright, didn't it?
c|Forget about it.
d|I wouldn't say anything--I would act.
d|All the time I've known you, you've never once asked about him.
q|What's your twenty?
d|Whoever they are -- this goes right back to Dallas -- it goes right back to the bombing --
q|You're saying God did it?
o|Hi, Dad.
d|I can spare me...
d|NO, YOU HAVE TO KILL ME.
d|With light clothing and no supplies, this is nobody's territory.
q|He was in love with you, right?
q|Don't you ever stop talking?
d|No, it grosses me out even thinking of putting something in my eye.
q|How's it going?
d|They're powering their forward weapons array.
d|I'm not even good for me.
d|They're in the approach corridor.
q|Can I have this?
d|I don't know, maybe you did kill somebody.
q|Did he come here too?
d|So talk to us about something.
q|Benjamin, is this your first time?
q|But, if they send you away, then what is to become of me?
o|You got to be fucking joking.
d|We just smeared a skunk.
d|Well, the twelve o'clock show is completely different than the nine.
d|Quantum is up thirty-five.
q|Will he wish to know the details of this night?
d|Ugh, I hate when that happens.
q|Yes, aren't you?
d|Jack was only at that branch once when he took the box years ago.
q|What about his first born?
q|Where did he get a hundred grand?
d|You're a policeman.
o|Not a Plymouth Fury, I bet.
o|Oh, come on.
d|Kind of wish I didn't.
q|Scotty -- what's left?
q|You didn't bother to find out, did you?
d|I'll take him.
d|I wish you wouldn't.
q|It's doing what?
q|Is this where you live?
d|That's where my father was killed.
q|You worried about the cost?
q|You want to ask me a question?
c|Sonny, be reasonable!
d|I don't have a pre-nup
o|Like I'm going to pay twenty bucks to see Neil Moynihan in some band that I helped start.
q|What's the story?
q|She has all the cooking talent.
c|Hush up such talk, Jabez!
d|I don't know what I've done.
c|Not now, pick me up.
o|Oh, he's adorable, Annie.
d|I'm in here.
d|They'll be okay if they know enough to stay in outta the rain.
q|Why's that?
d|I ain't askin' what you'll do after you get out, because I'm gonna be dead and it don't matter.
q|When you're frozen, you're legally dead, right?
q|Jeez. That's not a helluva lot, is it?
q|There's blood on your shirt.  Is that an integral part of your job?
c|Stop bein' so damn understandin'.
q|What'd I say again?
o|You don't say?
d|You find any cash in there, we'll whack it up with you.
d|It'll bleed.
d|I believe you still have my book.
c|Leave the rice cake outside and go home!
d|Captain, I don't know how much longer I can hold her together!
q|Sergeant, is Commander Skywalker back yet?
d|Look, you can't always like what you do. Sometimes you just do it because it's your job. And even if you don't like it, you just gotta do it anyway.
d|It seems we <U>all</U> imagine God in our own image.
q|Yeah, Mack, what is it?
d|No, it isn't that.
q|Did you hear what I said?
d|So I'm told.
d|You just got a Mickey.
d|Good news travels fast....
d|I'm looking for a party -- a merry party.
d|I think you've forgotten something.
d|I don't think that's how I would describe him.
c|That's it -- the release lever -- look inside!
q|How'd you know where to find me?
q|So what's going on, Joel?
o|Thanks, Pollux.
d|She was good in bed, though.
d|He asked to see a policeman, we're getting him a policeman.
q|Are ya closed to the General Public or to just everybody.
q|What, do you work for my boss, dog?
q|And what happens when you lose?
d|You always go with Andy.
c|Play it for us, please.
d|You're trying to get me to say something, that's why you're telling me all of this.
q|So what do you think we're gonna talk about?
d|Yeah, everything's under control.
d|I asked for a policeman.
d|I didn't mean to --
d|Last week, about 3 A.M., Fish -- Dr. Fisher -- was on a late shift, and he found her doing laundry.
d|Look, I'm real tired and I'm not interested in fucking chit-chat.
d|Well, that's illuminating.
d|We've been notified that they rejected the sentence...
d|That noise don't come from no ordinary bird.
d|There's nothing to see.
q|Don't you have a maid?
q|...how ya feeling, boy?
q|Are you going to let us in on what exactly you're trying to prove --
q|You're Mabel - her sister - aren't you?
c|No, don't say anything else!
d|I thought you were going to help Carl.
q|Your not gonna marry him are you?
d|I have a bad feeling about what you're doing.
q|What's a buzzer?
d|I pray for that.
d|I don't know.
d|That would hardly be proper.
d|I'll call them, Lowell.
d|This here's the desert an' we're right in it!
d|Conor, you and I, we cannot be killed.
q|Did you ever go to the Copa when I was away?
q|Shall we?
d|Well, I'm a college graduate --
o|The last one you'll ever see.
d|It is for me.
o|Oh, me -
q|You call this archaeology?
q|That too tight?
c|Steve, stop it please...
o|What an excellent day for an exorcism.
d|No need for divorce and that messy division-of-assets thing when they kick before you do.
q|What if it encourages the Tooth Fairy to do something besides write?
o|Thank you.
o|How about tomorrow?
o|Nice day
q|You've been working on this, huh?
d|I always liked ya so much...
q|Jeanne... what are you doing?
d|Beats fighting the flu, I'm here to tell you.
d|Drunks are funny--
d|Barely, yes.
d|There are things you know for sure.
c|Tell me the first thing that comes to your mind.
q|Will you wait until the chump is played?
q|Did your servant got word to Dr. Drossos?
d|Oh, uh, I resigned.
d|That guy in the cemetery today said he knew everything about Lauren.
d|Just hangin' out.
q|Why not?
q|This is all figured at three cents a copy.
o|Yah, okay, but, uh -
o|Oh, yes!  Yes!
d|I'm going to have to look into this.
d|It's not his job -- It's my job!
q|--you're a nurse, aren't you?
d|You don't seem very cut up about it.
q|How'd the show go?
o|Yes, something was...
o|See you tomorrow.
o|Uh-huh. And?
c|Arrest that woman!
d|It is kinda romantic.
d|I'm not a fool, Billy.
d|They'll be here.
d|Will, our offer starts you at eighty- four thousand a year, plus benefits.
d|But you're going to tell us anyway...
d|I know where Deauville is for C-C-Christ's sake.
q|Is it a jamming device?
q|Did she believe you?
q|You're a 53 year old shrink, what are you gonna do?
d|It's just that you strike me as a man trapped in a crisis of emotional direction, afflicted by a realization that the partner of your dreams is, quite simply, just that.
o|Detonation in twenty minutes.
d|You didnt seem to mind offering to help me on Christmas day when you were unwrapping that Prada bag I gave you.
d|We're coming!
q|How are you, Mr. Thatcher?
o|...Night Shift, but you might...
d|I felt so stupid just blowing those bubbles.
c|Now let's not get into a big hassle-
d|It pays to know your way around, Oliver.
d|With eleven hundred he could come home, and that's the last thing I want.
q|Isn't that what they always say?
o|Like into one of the other 20 or so bathrooms they've got in this place.
d|That's besides the point.
q|What is it with this guy?
d|I don't know about that?
q|Who are you calling?
o|Mm-hm.
o|I could kill that no good son of a bitch!
d|Aye, Toddy, there is something in what you say.
d|You tell me your name, I'll tell you mine.
q|You do know how to do that, don't you?
o|To bring the word of God.
d|H-he's so awkward and he's clumsy like me...
d|I'll be at the restaurant. </pre> </html>
q|What have you done to her?
q|What are you talking about?
d|It's like ringing the dinner bell.
d|You were not.
d|I don't know...
q|Father, are you okay?
d|We had the greatest afternoon of my life until Adrian made me tell her she had a heart-shaped ass.
c|Say "Mmmerrick."
d|I'll be there in 5 minutes.
o|There you go.
d|Something's wrong with the bio-scan.
q|What brings you out to these parts?
d|Nobody makes a car like them Nasis...
c|Please, be quiet.
c|~Don't shoot, G-Men..."
d|I'm serious.
q|Excuse me, but how old are you?
c|I command you, as King of the Britons to stand aside.
q|That obvious, huh?
q|What part of Dixie are you from, Duane?
q|Who's this guy I always see her around?
d|I'll watch for him, sir.
o|Well, when you put it that way.
q|Know what else is in here?
c|Stop now.
d|But I just don't feel it.
c|Include me in that.
d|You've created a monster.
q|Where do we start?
d|I just need you to be safe.
q|Michael, are you still in bed?
d|That's all. I just liked smelling her hair.
d|Well I guess Bill Munny wasn't no fearless killer an' bank robber like he said.
q|Christ.  How'd you get here?
d|These crowds are going to make it a bitch!
o|A flower...
d|I'm sorry, it was an accident.
o|What a ridiculous thing to say.
q|Who wants me to stop?
q|When will Strader return?
d|You should knock.
o|Appreciate it, sir.
q|What's your first move?
o|Actually, yes.
c|Dude, let's help Terrance and Phillip!!
d|Maybe one day -- after you've been married twenty years you'll understand.
d|I believe Agnes is different.
q|About what?
d|I didn't give any order to fire!
c|Hold on --
c|Leave her alone, you fiend!
d|Why, you're the preacher!
c|Why don't you come back up with me, Ronnie.
q|Why don't you just take me back without it?
q|Why do you care?
d|I was just different.
q|What'd he say?
q|And what happens if I don't call you?
q|Then what are you afraid of?
o|For Heaven's sakes!
d|This could be close.
q|Now why is that?
q|You all right, Professor Tripp?
o|Oh my gosh...
o|Okay, Mr. Book.
q|How will they come at you?
q|When you cut yourself pounding the door, did it hurt?
q|What do you say, Toby?,
q|Where were you going when you got in that cab?
q|Jesus, you alright?
q|Where do I pull off...?
q|So, why'd you want to see me?
d|Then these guys told me the police will find a huge amount of drugs inside the dead man's place.
q|How's it look?
d|No, I don't.
o|Oh! Oh!
q|What the hell does that mean?
d|I'm going to have to report you to the Department of Health.
d|I can't understand that.
q|Your hole is healed, then?
d|I haven't broken any laws.
c|Get back!
d|I'll be fine.
q|What does your lawyer think?
d|You paid off thirty grand I never owed.
d|But in the Latin alphabet, "Jehovah" begins with an "I".
o|Yes, Mr. Galvin?
q|They sure knocked the stuffings out of you, didn't they?
d|I think so too.
q|What is <u>this</u>?
d|I'm fine.
